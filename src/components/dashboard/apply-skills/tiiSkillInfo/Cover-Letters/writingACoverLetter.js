      <p class="header">Writing a Cover Letter</p>
      <p class="hcaption">
      Sometimes, you may need to write a cover letter for your application. A cover letter is an actual letter that you type that talks about why you want the job. While a resume lists your qualifications, a cover letter shows the more
      human side of you. There is no formula for a cover letter, but here is an outline for one.
      </p>



  <ol class="header2" start="1">
    <li>Heading</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">Here, you list your name, contact information, the date, who you are writing to regarding your application, and the company.</p>




  <ol class="header2" start="2">
    <li>Greeting</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">Here, you just write your &ldquo;Dear John,&rdquo;. It is as simple as that.</p>



  <ol class="header2" start="3">
    <li>Intro Paragraph</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">
      Here you begin to talk about your qualifications. You need to seem enthusiastic, this needs to hook in your employer, as this is often where they decide what they think of you. Talk
      about your biggest qualifications. Rope them in.
  </p>


  <ol class="header2" start="4">
    <li>Body Paragraphs</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="info">
Here, you really go into why you are a great candidate. Show why you are great to work as an intern, and how you have all the qualifications to do it. Hit on everything the employer
      wants.
  </p>

  <ol class="header2" start="5">
    <li >Conclusion</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="info">
Here, you seal the deal. Talk about the future here. You look forward to meeting with them in person to talk about your qualifications. Make them finish reading wanting to know more
      about you, wanting to hire you.
  </p>

  <ol class="header2" start="6">
    <li>Closing</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">
    And of course, your closing. This would be &ldquo;Sincerely, Dawn&rdquo; or something similar. It does not have to be sincerely, but avoid &ldquo;from&rdquo; or &ldquo;love&rdquo;.
  </p>



  <p class="tips">Tips </p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li class="info">
      <p>You should not feel the need to restate everything in your resume on your cover letter.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="info">Do not talk about how much you want or need the job, talk about why you are great for the job.</li>
    <li class="info">Be confident, and do not reuse the same words.</li>
  </ul>
