        Provided are some mock questions for an interview. Make sure you are practicing what you say and how you say it. Sit down as if this is a real interview. Obviously, you do not need to get dressed up for this as long as you do get
        dressed up for the real thing. Hopefully, you can get a family member to ask you these questions, but if not, you can ask them to yourself.
