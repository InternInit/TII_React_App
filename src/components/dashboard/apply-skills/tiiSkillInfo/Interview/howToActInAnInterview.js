  <p class="header">How to Act in an Interview</p>
  <p class="hcaption">Of course you know what you should say in an interview, but how should you act? Here we will look at that very same question. </p>
  <p class="header2">Voice </p>
  <p class="info">This should be obvious, but speak with a clear and confident voice. When you are talking, feel free to use your hands to talk to, but do not do it too much. Have a friendly, warm tone. </p>
  <p class="header2">Body Language </p>
  <p class="info">
      This is a big one. When you sit down, do not lean back. Sit up, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to put your arms on the table. You want to appear confident. Make eye contact with the interviewers when they are asking you questions, and
      smile. But remember, you do not want to be cocky. Only talk when after they ask you their question, they are the ones leading the interview.
     
  </p>
  <p class="header2">Dress </p>
  <p class="info">
      Of course, when you come in, you should be dressed professionally. Do not go overboard however, and bring a tuxedo. That would be weird. Make sure you pay attention to all of your dress. They can see your socks too! Even if you are
      doing a skype interview, make sure you are wearing professional pants too, just in case. Of course, comb back your hair as well, and if you are a guy, don&rsquo;t forget to shave! Make sure you shower the day of, and shampoo.
      Finally, clip your fingernails (unless you keep them long), because they can see your hands.
     
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <p class="conclusion">
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In conclusion, make sure you present yourself as confident, professional, and friendly. Even if you feel scared, do not let them see it. You want them to feel like this is not a line of questioning, but a professional conversation
      with a possible intern.
