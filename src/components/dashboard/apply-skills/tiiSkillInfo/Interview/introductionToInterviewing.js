        Before you get into our interviewing section, here is an overview on what we will talk about. We are going to talk about what questions you can expect, what you should say when answering those questions, how you should present
        yourself, and what you can do before and after an interview.
      
    </p>
    <p class="info">
        Of course, the best way to prepare for an interview is practice, so we will also be providing practice interview questions that you can give to yourself in the mirror or you can have a family member give to you.
