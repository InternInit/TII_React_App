  <p class="header">What to do Before and After the Interview</p>

  <p class="hcaption">Your interview may just be twenty minutes, but there are many things you can do both before and after it to better your odds.</p>
  <p class="header2">Before</p>
  <p class="info">
    
      Research where you are interviewing! Understand the industry, what they do, how they make a profit, and what your role would be in all of it if you are hired. But remember, you are being hired as an intern, not a manager. Do not
      plan on giving recommendations on how to fix the company large scale. If you are hired, you can then give people ideas, but before then.
    
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <p class="info">
  
      Also, check your social media! It is very likely that your interviewers will find you on instagram or twitter, so look at your social media. Anything you think will lower your chances of being hired, delete it, so they are less
      likely to see it. But do not delete your social media all together, because you still use it, and because they will still like to see other things, like vacations you went on.
    
  </p>

  <p class="header2">After</p>
  <p class="info">
    After your interview, it is a great idea to send them a thank you email. You can thank you for their time in the process, and if you can, mention something you talked about. A little goes a long way!
