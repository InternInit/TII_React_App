  <p class="header">What to Say in an Interview</p>
  <p class="hcaption">When in an interview, you need to know the actual words you should say. So here, we will look at some things you can expect them to ask you and what you should say in response.</p>

  <p class="header2">General Tips</p>
  <p class="info">Whenever answering questions, it is always good to bring things back to experiences. So here* is a good format to use on questions where it fits:</p>
  <ol class="list" start="1">
    <li class="info">Describe a problem you encountered</li>
    <li class="info">What you did in response to the problem</li>
    <li class="info">The result</li>
  </ol>
  <p></p>
  <p class="info">
    
      This is good when answering a question like &ldquo;How would you deal with a disgruntled client&rdquo; and you could answer that by first saying how you would (Try to see their side of the conflict, offer my help, etc), and then you
      can refer to a experience you had, and use the 3 steps to describe how you fixed it.
    
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="info">Also, when you are answering questions, do not keep referring to one experience or qualification, it will make the interviewer feel you have nothing to bring to the table.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="header2">Kinds of Questions to Expect and How to Answer Them</p>
  <p class="info">
    
      &ldquo;What is your best&hellip;&rdquo; When answering a question like this, mention one of your best qualities (without bragging of course), and bring it back to actual things where you practiced that skill or quality.
    
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="info">
    
      &ldquo;What is your worst&hellip;&rdquo; When answering this kind of question, DO NOT say you are too caring or too hard working, employers do not like to hear that. Instead, focus on flaws you had and how you have tried or are
      trying to improve upon them.
    
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="info">
    
      &ldquo;How would you go about&hellip;&rdquo; These questions can come in many forms, weather it being a difficult client or a workplace conflict, but what you need to do is bring up the 3 steps mentioned earlier. Of course say how
      you would deal with the problem, but mention times before where you have done similar things, using our 3 steps.

    <p class="tips">*Disclaimer: We want to say that for the 3 steps mentioned, while we did tweak it, we were inspired by Crash Course Business Soft Skills when creating it.</p>
