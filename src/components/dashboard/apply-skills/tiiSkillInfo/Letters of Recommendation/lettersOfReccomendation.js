  <p class="c1 title" id="h.h82n6p22jla3"><span class="c7">Letters of Recommendation</span></p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">Often employers will ask that you get letters of recommendation, where someone else will write something saying why you should be hired. They are not a big deal, here are just some things to know.</span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c3" id="h.47sizilzdreu"><span class="c5">Academic Letter of Recommendation</span></h2>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c0">If an employer asks for an academic letter of recommendation that means that they want one from your teacher. Your teacher will provide insight to your work ethic, motivation, and intelligence.</span></p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">
      When asking for a letter from one of your teachers, chose carefully. Even if your art teacher is your favorite teacher, it may be smarter to ask your biology teacher, since that is a more difficult class, and they can provide more
      insight on your work ethic. Also, ask a teacher who likes you, and whose class you are doing good in. If you have a C in Algebra and an A in English, you should probably ask your English teacher. So best case scenario, get a letter
      of recommendation from a teacher who likes you, whose class you do good in, and is a difficult class.
    </span>
  </p>
  <h2 class="c3" id="h.xb56g7d5vm5v"><span class="c5">Personal Letter of Recommendation</span></h2>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c0">If an employer asks for this kind of letter, that means they want a letter from someone who knows you and your character.</span></p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c0">For this kind of letter, it is not recommended you get one from a family member, your employer will know they are biased. Instead, ask for one from a coach, neighbor, or family friend.</span></p>
  <h2 class="c3" id="h.z2vinkw5g5v1"><span class="c5">Professional Letter of Recommendation</span></h2>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">
      This kind of letter is from someone you have worked for before. Because your employer knows that you are a high school student, they are less likely to ask you for one because you do not have professional work experience.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2"><span class="c0">If they do ask for one, you can get one from your boss if you work part time. Make sure when you ask for the letter they are in a good mood!</span></p>
  <h2 class="c3" id="h.hiwds34slv5"><span class="c5">Contacts</span></h2>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">
      Also, sometimes an employer will ask for a contact of someone you know who they can talk to to find out more about you. If they ask for one, MAKE SURE that you ask the person if you can list them as a contact. If you do not, that
      would be really embarrassing as your employer will realize that you did not talk to your contact about it beforehand.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
  <p class="c2">
    <span class="c0">In conclusion, Letters of Recommendation can be a great tool for an employer to get a deeper look into you. Just make sure that you ask for a letter early, because who you ask will need time to write it! </span>
