  <p class="header">What Should I Include on my Resume? </p>
     <span class="hcaption">
      When writing either a functional, reverse chronological, or combination resume, you have to know what must be included in the history/skills portions. Both these portions are similar in they are giving reasons to hire you, but while
      reverse chronological gives work experience and then how that experience would make you a good fit, functional gives character traits you have learned or have. Combination obviously does both. So here are some tips when writing this
      portion of your resume.
     
  </p>
   <p class=" header2">Also, be sure to keep these two big questions in mind: </p>
  <ol class="info" start="1">
    <li class="list"> What kind of intern does your employer want? </li>
    <li class="list"> How are you going to showcase that you are that intern? </li>
  </ol>
  <h2 class="header2">Tips </h2>
  <p class="info">
       Here are some qualities an employer wants in an intern: Teamwork, hardworking, friendly, intelligence, competent etc. You want to show these qualities when writing your resume. Here is how you do it in each one.
   </p>
  <p class="header2">Functional </p>
  <p class="info">
       Say you have these qualities straightforward in your skills section. Then, if you can, try to back them up with different things about you! Tie in different parts of your life and how they help you prove you have that skill. For
      example, start with the idea that you are a team player. Then support it with the fact that you were on the softball team. Now turn these two ideas into a cohesive statement you can put on your resume: Built teamwork skills through
      time spent on the softball team in working toward a shared goal. See? You can even add more evidence to each skill. For example: Furthered this through running a food drive with friends. So basically, in a functional resume, you
      should state a skill you have, and back it up with why/how you got it.
   </p>
   <p class="header2">Reverse Chronological </p>
  <p class="info">
     
      Here, it is sort of the opposite. You must first state work experience you had, and then explain why that makes you a good fit for the job. For example, if you worked at a pizza place, you could first mention the dates and name of
      the place, and what you have learned from it that makes you well suited for the job (Able to handle stress in a busy environment). If you can, include multiple things you learned from an experience. You could also mention that you
      learned to learned to work with difficult customers.
   </p>
   <p class="header2">Combination </p>
  <p class="info">For a combination resume, just use the processes for both resumes listed above and use them for both the skills and history section of your combination resume. </p>
  <p > </p>
  <p class="info">
       As you can see, in a functional resume you list skills you have and from what experiences you got them, while in a reverse chronological resume you list experiences you have and what skills you learned from them. So, if you are
      struggling in coming up with skills/experiences, this table could help.
