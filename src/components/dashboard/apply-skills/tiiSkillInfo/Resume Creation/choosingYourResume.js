  <p class="header">Choosing your Resume</p>
  <p class="hcaption">
    
      A Resume presents your skills, abilities, and accomplishments to your possible employer. However, there are many different ways to write your Resume, according to your talents. Let&rsquo;s discuss the three most common types of
      Resumes.
    
  </p>
  
  <ol class="header2" start="1">
    <li >Reverse Chronological</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">
    In this format, you list your work experience in reverse chronological order. This is good if you have a past of good work experience. Your abilities are not emphasized as much as work history here.<br />
  </p>
  <ol class="header2" start="2">
    <li  >Functional</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">
    
      In this format, instead of emphasizing your work history, you focus on your skills. This is great if you do not have a ton of work experience. You can mention past jobs, but those take backstage to the skills you bring to the table.
    
  </p>
   <ol class="header2" start="3">
    <li >Combination</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="info">
    
      This format is a mix of reverse chronological and functional. You include both your work history and your skills. This is good if you have work experience and important skills. However, these tend to be longer, and employers often
      like to see one page resumes.
    
  </p>
  <p></p>
   <p class="info">
    
      For your purposes as a high school student, we recommend either functional or combination resumes as it is highly unlikely that you have earlier work experience relevant to the positions you will be applying for. Once you have
      decided the format you would like to use, continue onto the next step in the google classroom titled &ldquo;Making your Resume&rdquo; for our guide to making one!
