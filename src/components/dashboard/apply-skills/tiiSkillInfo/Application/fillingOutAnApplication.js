      Filling Out an Application
    </p>

    <p class="hcaption">
        When you apply, you may be given an application for you to fill out. It
        is pretty straightforward, with general questions like your address and
        contact, but here are some tips for writing one.
    </p>


    <p class = "header2">
      Find a Clean Space to Fill it Out
    </p>
    <p class ="info">
        You should not be filling out your application during dinner or while
        you are eating, in case you get food on it. Instead, find a quiet,
        clean, place with a dry surface where you can put aside some time to
        fill it out.
    </p>



    <p class = "header2">
Use Pencil  </p>
    <p class = "info">
        If you use pen, you may make a spelling mistake. In that case, you would
        have to scribble it and write again, or use white out, both of which do
        not look good. Instead, use a sharp pencil just in case you make a
        mistake. If you do decide to use pen, plan out what you are going to
        write before you do write it, and look up any words you are not sure the
        spelling of before you write them.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="info">
        Also, spend a bit of extra time when writing to make sure your
        handwriting is neat. If your handwriting is messy, not only will your
        employer not be able to see what you wrote, they will think that you did
        not spend much time on the application.
    </p>


    <p class="header2">
    Open Response Questions
    </p>
    <p class = "info">
        Sometimes, an application will have open response questions for you to
        fill out. If this is the case, you should fill up all the space given.
        You do not need to go over the amount of space given, but try to find
        enough things to fill it up. It will make the employer see that you
        spent a lot of time on the application.
    </p>
    <p class = "header2">Read it Over</p>

    <p class="info">
        Please, when you are done filling out your application, read it over!
        You want to check for spelling or grammar mistakes, or anything you
        forgot to mention. It can even be a good idea for you to have someone
        else read it over so you can have a second pair of eyes see what you
        wrote.
